OppGave
=======

This program was created with the intention of being a learning tool for myself and a friend who is learning PHP. I am using it to learn Slim, and they are learning another's programming style. All it does is use a flat-file database similar to htpasswd to manage some users and their profiles.

Installation
------------

1. `git clone git@github.com:am2064/oppgave.git`
2. `composer install`

Running
-------

I personally use php's built-in web server due to its debugging capabilities and error log.

`php -S localhost:5000`

Then just access http://localhost:5000 and it should start to work.
